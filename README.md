# RefractivePS

#  # Description

This project tries to the photometric stereo problem, in the case where there are refractive materials encassing the surface.


# # Files

The following is a description of the important files in the project


pslib.py  -  contains general functions relevervant for ps and the project
refplanePS - Contains the functions relevervant for solving the PS problem with a refractive plane
refplanePSdemonstration.py - A file for demonstrating the feastures and progress of the project
test_refraction.py - A file containg several unit test functions
